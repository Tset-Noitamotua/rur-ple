RUR-PLE - RUR - Python Learning Environment

RUR - Python Learning Environment (RUR-PLE) is an educational tool to help students learn the Python programming language. Made by Andr√© Roberge. RUR-PLE uses the idea behind Karel the Robot, making the learning of Python programming more interesting. A student writes a program that controls a 'robot' that moves through a city consisting of a rectangular grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down).

It is very similar to Guido van Robot (GvR), but RUR-PLE can use all Python features (while GvR only limited subset of syntax). RUR-PLE has 48 lessons (in main European languages and Chinese) with the code and robot environment examples to experiment with.

A second implementation of RUR-PLE, Rurple NG is in progress.[2]
